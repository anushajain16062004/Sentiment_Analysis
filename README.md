# Sentiment_Analysis
This repository contains a Python script to perform emotion analysis on a text file. It processes the input text, identifies emotions associated with specific words, and visualizes the results as a bar chart.

1.Text Cleaning:
Converts text to lowercase.
Removes punctuation for better word matching.

2.Stop Words Removal:
Filters out common words like "the", "is", and "and" that don't add meaningful context.

3.Emotion Extraction:
Matches words in the text with emotions defined in an external file (emotions.txt).

4.Visualization:
Creates a bar chart of detected emotions using matplotlib.
Saves the chart as graph.png.
